The intent of this mod to introduce some of the fun of the 1984 game Boulder Dash.   
Adds the ability to tunnel through dirt simply by walking through it.  Adds boulders that will fall on you if you are not careful when tunneling. It also makes dirt layers deeper by default (30 nodes rather than 3). 
Goal: you are trying to find as many purple gems as possible.  They shatter when you touch them, and there is a very rudimentary scoring system that gives you 10 points for each one you touch.  The score is just logged in the chat.  The 3D element of minetest makes it very different from the game Boulder Dash.  Don't expect a fully finished game.  These are just some loosely stitched together components that just hints at the original game.

Future enhancements include:
1. Adding a setting to specify how often the boulders spawn (scarcity)
2. Allowing the user to push/roll boulders
3. If a boulder winds up on top of another boulder have it roll off to the side
4. Better scoring system

The plan is to have all of these "boulder_dig" mods function as stand alone mods so that they can combined in other ways with other mods to work with and create other games.

From [Wikipedia] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder_Dash_(video_game):

> Boulder Dash takes place in a series of caves, each of which is laid out as rectangular grid of blocks. The player guides the player character, Rockford, with a joystick or arrow keys. In each cave, Rockford has to collect as many diamonds as are needed and avoid dangers, such as falling rocks. When enough diamonds have been collected, the exit door opens, and going through this exit door completes the cave.
